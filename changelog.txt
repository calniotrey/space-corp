1.3.1
[*] Fix construction ships not building in some rare cases
[*] Add a monthly pacifying/neutral/hostile making code, so that corps mimick their overlord's hostility to other factions. Notably, it should make them stop hostility with space fauna
[*] Should be savegame compatible

1.3.0
[*] Various small fixes for Stellaris 3.10.4
[*] Change links between corps and overlord, preparing for multiple corps on a single hq
[*] Fix the corps random name
[*] Fix the corps civics by determining them by script rather than letting vanilla pick vanilla civics
[*] Fix the hq deposit not initialising variables to prevent error.log spam (no gameplay issue)
[*] Fix two different scripted effects going over the max depth (wasn't an issue before, so why now Stellaris?)
[*] Give the corps civics bonuses (financial has energy production bonus, ...)
[*] Fix convoy not moving by adding special hyperdrives
[*] Fix the fleet power limit for corps
[*] Rebuild the logic for corp fleet reinforcement: if 4 or less fleet, build more. If 9 or less, reinforce to 500fp, then build more. 14-, reinforce to 1k, then build more. 19- to 2k. 20+ reinforce always and never build more (the corp should already have 40k+ fp)
[*] Buffed some corps level 10 hq. They now have 1 job per level, a bonus at level 5 and another one at 10 (similar in power to level 5). Additionnaly, 0.05 job per pop at level 10

1.2.1
[*] Corps science ships' leaders gain experience upon surveying
[*] Increase max mining and research stations per corp from 10 each to 15 each, except for mining unions and research consortiums which have double of mining and research respectively.

[*] Improved builder AI by preventing builders having the same overlord to try to buy in the same system

1.1.3
[*] Block corp ship spawn when solar system starbase is captured and when planet is occupied
[*] Check and respawn deposits when needed (if they were removed by a mod/terraformation/...)
[*] Remove use of closest_system to improve performance (around 20% less lag generated)
[*] Limit corps fleet power to around 1/4 of the overlord
1.1.2
[*] Fix a bug where corps researching a tech would not remove the tech cost from their tech points
